What is Markup Language:

A markup language is a set of rules that defines how the layout and presentation of text and images should appear in a digital document. It allows structuring documents, adding formatting, and specifying how different elements should be displayed (or “rendered”) on webpages.

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):

Widely used for creating and structuring content on the World Wide Web.
Defines the elements and structure of web pages.

Example:

<html>
    <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </body>
</html>

Key Characteristics:

1. Tags: Markup languages use tags, which are enclosed within angle brackets (< and >), to define elements in the document. Tags are usually paired, with an opening tag indicating the start of an element and a closing tag indicating its end.

Example:

<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>

2. Attributes: Tags can include attributes that provide additional information about an element. Attributes are added to the opening tag and typically consist of a name and a value.

Example:

<img src="image.jpg" alt="An example image">

3. Nesting: Elements can be nested within each other to represent hierarchical relationships. The order and structure of tags determine how elements are nested.

Example:

<div>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph within a div.</p>
</div>

Absolute Path:

An absolute path provides the full address or location of a file or directory from the root directory. 

Relative Path:

A relative path, on the other hand, specifies the location of a file or directory relative to the current working directory. 

*****************************************************************************************
Block-level Elements:

A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: <p> and <div>.

The <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.

Inline Element:

An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.
Example:<a>,<abbr>,<button>
